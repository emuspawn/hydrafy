Current Version: 1.0

Changes:
#1.0
- Complete makeover of hydra.sh
- Addition of a parsing function to specify which type of grep the user would like
- The patched up version of hydra has been removed since there is now a public version of hydra v7.2 available at thc.org/thc-hydra

#0.6
- The change for 0.5 has now been fixed and we are back to using -C flags.  Included in the repo is a patched up version of hydra.  Read the development notes in the comments of hydra.sh for more information

#0.5
- Implemented sort and uniq filters for creation of user.txt and pass.txt.  This significantly lessened the advent of incorrect entries.  This is a temporary fix until a patch for Hydra with the -C flag is released

#0.3
- Add version control to router.lst and spread.ods
- Fixed router.lst to avoid unnecessary spaces which resulted in improper username/pass entry into hydra
- Documented a bug with the -C flag for hydra, temporary use of -L and -P flags as a result of this bug till hydra is patched
- Added in some case to replace if statements

#0.1
- Beta release
