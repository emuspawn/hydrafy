## Remember that time when you were auditing a network and you got to the point where you tried to login to the router via a web-page and manually tried a bunch of default usernames and passwords to see if the Sys Admin for the site had secured it? Remember how long it took? ##

Freely available on the Internet, you can find hundreds upon hundreds of websites that list the default username and passwords for a given router.

No where on the Internet however, is there a place to download them all in one place where the results are easily grepped and parsed.... Until now.
Welcome to the Hydrafy Project.  Started in the winter of 2012, it aims to becomes the defacto standard for a single database of default usernames and passwords .  If you have information regarding a router manufacturer that is not listed within spread.ods please contact me [here](mailto:will@configitnow.com).

This has been ported for usage with the N900..!
